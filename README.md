# setup_linux

Automatic development setup for debian/ubuntu linux.

I've been creating setup series to install or setup my develop environment automatically.
- Setup for Vim and basic command line : https://github.com/raacker/setup_vim 
- Setup for jekyll blog : https://github.com/raacker/setup_blog 
- Setup for python development : https://github.com/raacker/setup_python 
- Setup for web development : https://github.com/raacker/setup_web

And this repo is for setting up linux mint with whole setups.

Feel free to fork and modify them for your custom commands or welcome to PR on this repo.


**Manual installations required**
1. install jekyll packages of atom
2. set config file from setup_intellij
3. modify .bashrc to see git branch name on terminal -> check setup_vim
